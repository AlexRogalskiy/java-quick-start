# Jakarta EE with Apache TomEE Maven template for Platform.sh

This project provides a starter kit for Spring Boot Maven with Solr projects hosted on [Platform.sh](http://platform.sh).

We include recommended .platform.app.yaml and .platform files that should suffice for most use cases. You are free to tweak them as needed for your particular site.

## Platform.sh configuration files

* [`.platform/routes.yaml`](.platform/routes.yaml): Platform.sh allows you to define the [routes](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/routes.html).
* [`.platform/services.yaml`](.platform/services.yaml):  Platform.sh allows you to completely define and configure the topology and [services you want to use on your project](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/services.html).
* [`.platform.app.yaml`](.platform.app.yaml): You control your application and the way it will be built and deployed on Platform.sh [via a single configuration file](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app-containers.html).
